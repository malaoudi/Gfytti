# Goal: 
To be able to interact with Gfycats in virtual reality using HoloLens headset, where it searches for gfycats and place them in environment.
# Overview: 
I was trying on my friendâ€™s VR headset that he received from Facebook Inc. as a sample designed by Oculus company, so we were
amazed at the applications and benefits that the headset can bring such as better training for employees, better hands-on learning, and
entertainments, so when participating along a team of coders at a university hackathon, we discussed how VR and headsets are still short and
plain in interactive features so we came up with the the idea of extending and adding feature to enhance HoloLens headsets. We have seen gfycat
on our computers. We have seen gfycat on our mobile devices, so we wanted to bring a new level of immersion and interaction to gifs on the
web. Instead of just watching gifs. Instead of just visting a gfycat link, Gfytti allows you to use gifs on the HoloLens, place them on the walls,
and watch them. Gfytti allow users to interact with the gfycats, where they become part of a user environment. We needed live streaming of
gfycats, so we used unity to support video formats, and OGVs, and used our own server to convert them live. A user can search for a gif and
leave it for everyone else to see and interact with. We succeeded in developing software for adding interactable gfycats into HoloLens headset.
# Tools: 
Gfytti was developed with Unity, C#, HoloLens Headsets, VR Headsets, Toolkit,
